                    💡 I am a passionate computer science , Electronics and Communication engineering student with strong interests in cybersecurity, electronics, robotics, and software development. I enjoy creating practical and innovative projects by combining coding with hands-on electronics skills.

I have experience working with web development, Python, JavaScript, and embedded systems (Arduino, ESP boards). Along with that, I love experimenting with DIY projects—building useful tools, crafting creative solutions, and exploring how software and hardware can work together.

In my free time, I enjoy playing football, learning about the latest tech trends, and improving my skills through personal projects. My goal is to grow as a tech enthusiast and developer, continuously learning and applying knowledge to solve real-world problems.
